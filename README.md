# anime-survey-form
The second web design project from freeCodeCamp that showcases a form webpage

The following survey form was created by Matthew Johnson. It was created after following the freecodecamp web design learning track. The purpose is to showcase introductory web design skills with purely HTML and CSS.

The survey is about anime because I watch a lot of it. Not a serious webpage and the input isn't being recorded anywhere. 

The content isn't meant to be serious at all and is just there to show off the web page styling.
